Module url_cache.sites.myanimelist.urls.v4
==========================================
Converts MyAnimeList URLs to Jikan API URLs
This uses v4 of the API

This makes no requests, it just parses URLs
and creates the corresponding URLs to request for Jikan

Classes
-------

`MalParseResult(cleaned: str, jikan_urls: List[str])`
:   MalParseResult(cleaned, jikan_urls)

    ### Ancestors (in MRO)

    * builtins.tuple

    ### Instance variables

    `cleaned: str`
    :   Alias for field number 0

    `jikan_urls: List[str]`
    :   Alias for field number 1

`Version4(base_url: str = 'https://api.jikan.moe/v4')`
:   Converts MyAnimeList URLs to their corresponding Jikan counterparts.
    
    Only supports a subset of the URLs -- this doesnt support user lists
    or pages that change very often (searches, seasonal listings, history pages)
    as it wouldn't be as useful to cache those

    ### Methods

    `parse_url(self, url: str) ‑> Optional[url_cache.sites.myanimelist.urls.v4.MalParseResult]`
    :   Given a URL, if extra information can be extracted by requesting info from Jikan
        this cleans the URL to reduce duplicates and returns the Jikan URLs to request
